##  How to Play

1. When the game starts, each player selects their preferred stone design from a list of emoji options.
2. Players take turns entering a position in the format `rowcolumn` (e.g., `d3`, `e6`).
3. The board will update and flip opponent stones automatically based on the rules.
4. If a player has no valid moves, their turn is skipped.
5. The game ends when neither player has any valid moves left.
6. The player with the most stones wins!
